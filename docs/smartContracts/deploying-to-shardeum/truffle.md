title: Using Truffle
sidebar_position: 2

Truffle is a world-class development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier.

## Environment Setup

There are a few technical requirements for developers to start using Truffle. Install the following dependencies:

- NodeJS v12 or later ([available here](https://nodejs.org/en/))
- Npm/Yarn Package Installer (included with Node)
- Windows, Linux or Mac OS X

## Installing Truffle

Once the above dependencies are installed successfully. You can now install Truffle.

```
npm install -g truffle
```

To verify that Truffle is installed properly, type truffle version into the terminal (cmd).

## Creating a Project

After ensuring Truffle is installed successfully. Create your own project, name it "testToken".

 - Create a new directory for your Truffle project

```
mkdir testToken
cd testToken
```

- Initialize your project

```
truffle init
```
Once this operation is complete, you'll now have a project structure with the following items:

1. contracts/: Directory for Solidity contracts
2. migrations/: Directory for scriptable deployment files
3. test/: Directory for test files for testing your application and contracts
4. truffle-config.js: Truffle configuration file
5. build(visible after compile): Compiled Solidity contracts with bytecode and ABI

## Create Contract

You can write your own smart contract, or use open-source openzeppellin standard contracts and buidl on top of them.

We are using openzeppelin for our testToken, which requires a dependency.

```
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

After the dependency is installed, create a file named "testToken.sol" in the contract directory.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract testToken is ERC20 {
  constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("testTkn", "TST") { _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
  }
}
```

## Compile Contract

To compile a Truffle project, change to the root directory (in our case testToken directory) and run the command in the terminal.

```
truffle compile
```
## Coding Migrations

To deploy our testToken contract on Shardeum Liberty, we have to create a migration to get the contract on the network.
Create a file in the migrations folder named "2_deploy.js".

```
var test = artifacts.require("testToken");

module.exports = function(deployer) {
  // deployment
  deployer.deploy(test, '10000000000000000000000');
};
```

## Configuring Truffle For Shardeum Liberty

- Go to truffle-config.js (located in root directory)
- Update with Shardeum Liberty details ([available here](/Network/endpoints))

```
const HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider');
const fs = require('fs');
const mnemonic = fs.readFileSync(".secret").toString().trim();

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",     // Localhost (default: none)
      port: 8545,            // Standard port (default: none)
      network_id: "*",       // Any network (default: none)
    },
    liberty: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `https://liberty10.shardeum.org/`),
      network_id: 8080,
      confirmations: 2,
      timeoutBlocks: 200,
      skipDryRun: true
    }
  },

  // Set default mocha options here, use special reporters etc.
  mocha: {
    // timeout: 100000
  },

  // Configure your compilers
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "^0.8.0", // A version or constraint - Ex. "^0.5.0"
    }
  }
}

```
**Note:** Make sure to add your mnemonic or private key and add it to a separate file ".secret" (make sure never to upload this file to GitHub or GitLab).

Make sure you have @truffle/hdwallet-provider dependency installed, if not install it using the below command.

```
npm i @truffle/hdwallet-provider
```

## Deploying on Shardeum Liberty

To deploy our testToken contract run this command in the testToken directory:

```
truffle migrate --network liberty
```

The contract will be deployed on Shardeum Liberty, it should look like this:

```

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed ERC20 Smart Contract. Now you can interact with the Smart Contract by building a dApp.
